1. The history of data management platforms.
data management platforms evolved to be data intelligence platforms.
In 1980, businesses needed more than relational databases.

Data warehouse:
pros:
support for Structured & Clean data, eg: csv
Predefined schemas
Business Intelligence (BI)
Analytics

cons:
no support for semi or unstructured data, eg: txt, JSON, image, video
inflexible schemas
struggled with the large volume of data
long processing time

In 2000, big data came into the picture.
Data lakes:
pros:
Flexible data storage (structured or semi or unstructured)
streaming support
cost efficient in the cloud
support for AI and Machine Learning

cons: lacks necessary features from data warehouses
No transactional support
poor data quality and reliability - due to various data formats
slow analysis performance - due to a large volume of data
data governance concerns - due to the unstructured nature of content
data warehouse still needed

In 2021, lakehouse architecture was introduced.
lakehouse - an open and unified foundation for all your data.
